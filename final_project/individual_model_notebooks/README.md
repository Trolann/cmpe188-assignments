## These notebooks were the individual work for the `final_notebook.ipynb` file.

- Each person was responsible for one notebook overall, with others providing feedback
- `perform_kickstarter_eda.py` is a script version of the `trevor_eda` notebooks, placed in one spot to allow for individual notebooks to use the same training/test data
